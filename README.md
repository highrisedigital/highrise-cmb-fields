# Highrise CMB Fields

This is an add-on plugin for the CMB framework plugin from Human Made which allows you to utilise a number of different field types including:

* Gallery
* Email
* Attachment List
* Post Checkbox
* Number
* Information Field

## How do I add the new fields?

The new field types are used in exactly the same way as the existing field types with Custom Meta Boxes. The only different is passing a different `type` parameter through to the filter. See the Wiki for examples of how to use the different field types provided with this plugin.
